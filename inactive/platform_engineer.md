### About Banked

Banked intends to create the next global payments network. We believe credit and debit cards were created for a world that no longer exists, and technology will enable us to create a new, living payments network. We believe that the core purpose of a payment network is to enable sales and conversion, not to just move money and we're doing that with data in a way no one has seen before.

We're very fortunate that COVID has meant growth in our business. As more transactions move online and as merchants focus more on improving margins our innovative, fundamentally different model for a payment network is gaining more and more traction.

We've always enabled remote working as a company, and COVID has given us the opportunity to embrace that even more; our team is now 100% distributed, and we believe it's the right way for us to continue to scale our mission.

### **About the role and the team**

We're looking for someone who shares our vision, who identifies with our desire to reinvent payments and will help guide us through our growth to directly compete with Visa and Mastercard.

You'll participate in the direction of the company and products, you'll be part of small team where everyone has a voice.

As a Platform Engineer at Banked, you'll be building the foundation of our system. You'll use Go and its ecosystem to build observability tools and core services that will ensure the reliability of our mission-critical system and API's.

You'll empower other engineers to build scalable, reliable, and observable systems. You'll also solve a series of interesting technical problems. 

We don't expect people to be experts with all of the technology we use or to immediately be able to pickup all the tasks we might ask of them. We want to build an environment where people can learn and grow openly, where failure is accepted as a part of learning and there's enough to support to help people be successful.


### **You will**

- Work to improve all aspects of application reliability, including monitoring, alerting, and deployment
- Build tools and platform components to improve our system's reliability, scalability, and observability and work with the engineering teams to utilize them.
- Help the team improve engineering standards, tooling, and process through mentoring, guidance, and collaboration
- Be part of the first response team in dealing with incidents and issues our platform
- Help the engineering teams troubleshoot in complex environments using the monitoring tools
- Help build a culture of DevOps in engineering, where engineers own their code throughout its lifetime
- Work with other engineers and product managers across the company to prioritise,
build, measure, and iterate new features/products

### **You may be a good fit if you have**

- Significant experience in communicating and working with software teams, and
working towards building inclusive, fun environments
- Experience building tools for observability and reliability of mission-critical, distributed systems
- Experience with public cloud environments  - Google Cloud is an advantage
- Experience with Kubernetes
- Experience with troubleshooting performance problems and system outages.
- Commercial experience in Go



### **Any combination of the following would make your application stand out**

- Experience working in regulated environments, like fintech
- Experience working with open telemetry tools
- Experience working with Prometheus Stack 
- Experience with event-driven architectures



### The interview process

The interview process will focus on four areas: your experience building and operating systems; your technical skills; and, your ability to work within and support a wider engineering organization; how you'll fit in culturally with the rest of the team.

We want to take your time seriously, and use as little of it as possible to make our decision. We will also commit to giving you constructive, meaningful feedback whether we decide to move forward together or not.

All interviews will take place remotely, via Zoom.

Your interview will be broken down into four stages, scheduled separately and with feedback after each:

1. An initial call with our head of platform to outline the company and the role, and for you to share your career experience. If there's a good fit to move forward, we'll continue with a technical interview.
2. A technical interview with the Engineering Lead alongside another member of the team. It's a chance for you to share your technical knowledge in a little more depth. We'll outline a few high-level technical problems and discuss possible solutions together. 
3. A small coding challenge to complete in your own time.
4. A second technical interview where:
   - Will go over your coding challenge 
   - Meet our VP Engineering and talk more about your experiance, system architecture and reliability challenges

After these steps you will have a final conversation with our Head of Operations about the high-level direction of the company, what you want to achieve with your career, and how Banked can help you achieve it. 
At this point we should have enough information to make you an offer, should it be appropriate.
 
You'll be given the chance to ask questions at all of these stages, and we would encourage you to do so. After each of the three stages you'll be given structured feedback and should we choose not to progress you'll be offered the chance to talk with our VP Engineering to understand our decision.
