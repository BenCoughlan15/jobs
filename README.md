## Banked Jobs

This repository is the canonical source for open roles at Banked. We mirror these roles and their descriptions to several other platforms. All open roles are in the base level of this directory. 

There's a `./hired` directory that contains roles we've already hired people into, we keep it there to give potential candidates context on the roles we've hired for in the past and how we describe them.

If you have any questions about Banked, our open roles or how we work as a team please contact jobs@banked.com, we'd love to talk to you.
