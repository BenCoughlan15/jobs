### About Banked
Banked intends to create the next global payments network. We believe credit and debit cards were created for a world that no longer exists, and technology will enable us to create a new, living payment network. We believe that the core purpose of a payment network is to enable sales and conversion, not to just move money and we're doing that with data in a way no one has seen before.<BR>
COVID created a global pandemic, however, we are fortunate that COVID has meant growth in our business. As more transactions move online and as merchants focus more on improving margins our innovative, fundamentally different model for a payment network is gaining more and more traction.<BR>
We've always enabled remote working as a company, and COVID has allowed us to embrace that even more; our team is now 100% distributed, and we believe it's the right way for us to continue to scale our mission. 

### About the role and the team
We're looking for someone who shares our vision, who identifies with our desire to reinvent payments and will help guide us through our growth to directly compete with Visa and Mastercard.<BR>
You'll participate in the direction of the company and products, you'll be part of a small team where everyone has a voice.<BR>
As a Software Engineer in Test at Banked, you'll be working on the integrity and quality of everything we build. From our customer-facing products to financial infrastructure moving money around the world.<BR>
Someone who enjoys working as a team and wants to learn and grow will be most successful.<BR>
We don't expect people to be experts with all of the technology we use or to immediately be able to pick up all the tasks we might ask of them. We want to build an environment where people can learn and grow openly, where failure is accepted as a part of learning and there's enough support to help people be successful.<BR>

### The interview process
The interview process will focus on three areas: your experience building products and taking on technical challenges; your technical skills; and how you'll fit in culturally with the rest of the team.<BR>
We want to take your time seriously, and use as little of it as possible to make our decision. We will also commit to giving you constructive, meaningful feedback whether we decide to move forward together or not.<BR>
All interviews will take place remotely, via Zoom.<BR>
Your interview will be broken down into three stages, scheduled separately and with feedback after each: 
- A 30-minute interview with your team's Engineering Lead, where we'll tell you about the role, understand your experience, and professional background and understand common interests. At the end of this meeting, we will provide a coding challenge.  The candidate shall provide a solution and share it via GitHub, within 1-2 days.
- A 60-minute interview with the Lead Quality engineer, where we will discuss the candidate's solution to the coding challenge and other quality engineering technical aspects, practises and expectations.
- In the final stage of the interview, the candidate will meet the Engineering Lead for further technical discussions. And will meet our chief of staff to understand what you want to achieve with your career and how Banked can help you achieve it.

At this point we should have enough information to make you an offer, should it be appropriate.

You'll be given the chance to ask questions at all of these stages, and we would encourage you to do so. After each of the three stages you'll be given structured feedback and should we choose not to progress you'll be offered the chance to talk with the team's Engineering Lead to understand our decision.
