### About Banked

Banked intends to create the next global payments network. We believe credit and debit cards were created for a world that no longer exists, and technology will enable us to create a new, living payments network. We believe that the core purpose of a payment network is to enable sales and conversion, not to just move money and we're doing that with data in a way no one has seen before.

We're very fortunate that COVID has meant growth in our business. As more transactions move online and as merchants focus more on improving margins our innovative, fundamentally different model for a payment network is gaining more and more traction.

We've always enabled remote working as a company, and COVID has given us the opportunity to embrace that even more; our team is now 100% distributed, and we believe it's the right way for us to continue to scale our mission.

### About the role and the team

We're looking for someone who shares our vision, who identifies with our desire to reinvent payments and will help guide us through our growth to directly compete with Visa and Mastercard. 

You'll participate in the direction of the company and products, you'll be part of small team where everyone has a voice.

As a full-stack Software Engineer at Banked you'll be working on our front-end web applications and SDKs (using tools like React, WebPack and Web Components) alongside our back-end services and APIs (using Ruby on Rails).

Someone who enjoys working on a small team and wants to learn and grow will be most successful.

We don't expect people to be experts with all of the technology we use or to immediately be able to pickup all the tasks we might ask of them. We want to build an environment where people can learn and grow openly, where failure is accepted as a part of learning and there's enough support to help people be successful.

So if you're a Front-end Engineer who wants to do more full-stack work or someone who's spent time working with React and wants to branch out, we'd love to talk to you.

### You will

- Work with other engineers, product managers and designers across the company to prioritise, build, measure and iterate over new features or products
- Build elegant interfaces which will be hosted by us, embeddable by our clients and integratable as components; focusing on on web performance and accessibility
- Build APIs and services that reliably deliver functionality to our customers
- Improve engineering standards, tooling and processes as we grow
- Be part of the team evolving architecture and design of our software stack
- Mentor and help grow your peers and junior engineers, as well as be open to feedback and mentoring from those around you

### You may be a good fit if you have

- Significant experience in communicating and working with software teams, and working towards building inclusive, fun environments
- A track record of taking software end-to-end, from inception working alongside product managers and designers to production and beyond
- A passion for learning and growth, picking up new skills and tools
- Very strong working experience working with JavaScript, HTML, CSS and HTTP APIs
- Experience working within the React stack and modern Javascript development tools such as Babel and Webpack
- Familiarity with modern browser APIs and the web platform
- Testing modern interfaces and front-end code
- A track record of developing for system maintainability and ease of operation
- Deep understanding of the web development process, design, development, testing and deployment

### Any combination of the following would make your application stand out

- Experience in mentoring and building the skills of junior engineers
- Experience with Ruby on Rails
- A presence in and experience engaging public web communities
- Experience working with Go
- Experience building JavaScript SDKs and libraries
- Experience building cross-platform native apps using ReactNative

### The interview process

The interview process will focus on three areas: your experience building products and taking on technical challenges; your technical skills; and how you'll fit in culturally with the rest of the team.

We want to take your time seriously, and use as little of it as possible to make our decision. We will also commit to giving you constructive, meaningful feedback whether we decide to move forward together or not.

All interviews will take place remotely, via Zoom.

Your interview will be broken down into three stages, scheduled separately and with feedback after each:

1. A 30 minute interview with our CTO, where we'll tell you about the role, understand your experience and whether there's a good fit to move forward
2. A 90-minute interview, where:
    1. You'll spend 30 minutes talking to our VP Engineering about your experience and background; then
    2. A further 60 minutes talking to our VP Engineering and another engineer on the team where you'll be presented with a high-level technical problem and then you'll discuss a solution to it
3. A second, 90 minute interview, where:
    1. You'll talk to our Head of Operations for 45 minutes about your previous experience, what you want to achieve with your career and how Banked can help you achieve it
    2. You'll then spend the final 45 minutes with our co-founder and CEO so you can learn more about the company, our mission and how this role fits into our success

After this point we should have enough information to make you an offer, should it be appropriate.

You'll be given the chance to ask questions at all of these stages, and we would encourage you to do so. After each of the three stages you'll be given structured feedback and should we choose not to progress you'll be offered the chance to talk with our CTO to understand our decision.
