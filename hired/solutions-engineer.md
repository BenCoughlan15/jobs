### About Banked

Banked intends to create the next global payments network. We believe credit and debit cards were created for a world that no longer exists, and technology will enable us to create a new, living payments network. We believe that the core purpose of a payment network is to enable sales and conversion, not to just move money and we're doing that with data in a way no one has seen before.

We're very fortunate that COVID has meant growth in our business. As more transactions move online and as merchants focus more on improving margins our innovative, fundamentally different model for a payment network is gaining more and more traction.

We've always enabled remote working as a company, and COVID has given us the opportunity to embrace that even more; our team is now 100% distributed, and we believe it's the right way for us to continue to scale our mission.

### **About the role and the team**

We're looking for someone who shares our vision, who identifies with our desire to reinvent payments and will help guide us through our growth to directly compete with Visa and Mastercard. 

You'll participate in the direction of the company and products, you'll be part of small team where everyone has a voice.

A Solutions Engineer at Banked works with our largest and most complex customers to design and develop advanced payments infrastructure. They are experienced engineers with a strong background developing integrations, consulting with customers to understand their objectives, and leveraging technology to drive business value.

You'll be Banked's first full-time Solutions Engineer, working alongside our CTO and leadership team to drive impact with our customers. You'll help establish and build this capability at Banked and be a key member of the team.

We don't expect people to be experts with all of the technology we use or to immediately be able to pickup all the tasks we might ask of them. We want to build an environment where people can learn and grow openly, where failure is accepted as a part of learning and there's enough to support to help people be successful.

### **You will**

- Become an expert on Banked’s APIs, products and how to best deploy them
- Provide structured feedback and work closely with Banked’s product engineering team
- Work hand-in-hand with Banked’s Sales and Customer Success teams to develop proof of concept applications, present technical demonstrations, and help Banked customers make the most of their integration
- Work closely with Banked's product engineering team to build, iterate and optimize our external documentation
- Own and drive relationships with external technical audiences of all kinds — from engineers to CTOs — to understand business objectives and translate requirements into solutions
- Engage with and drive adoption in the wider developer community, working to raise Banked's profile and build Banked's reputation in the community

### **You may be a good fit if you have**

- Experience as an engineer, with previous background building web or mobile applications
- Experienced in full stack development and software architecture patterns, able to understand how a wide variety of technologies and systems interact with each other
- A great communicator, comfortable explaining complex concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences
- Interested in solving open ended business problems with a combination of technology and creative thinking
- Experienced working in the sales and onboarding lifecycle and driving outcomes in a customer-facing environment

### **Any combination of the following would make your application stand out**

- Is comfortable writing code in a few of Banked’s primary deployment languages (Ruby, Go, JavaScript) and enjoys learning new languages and technologies
- Has experience integrating Banked or other RESTful APIs into web applications
- Has a background working in a similar customer-facing role (e.g. solutions architect, sales engineer, or partner engineer)
- Thrives in a cross-functional, collaborative environment
- Has experience engaging deeply with developer communities
- Has a background in working in regulated environments or payments

### The interview process

The interview process will focus on three areas: your experience building products and taking on technical challenges; your technical skills; and how you'll fit in culturally with the rest of the team.

We want to take your time seriously, and use as little of it as possible to make our decision. We will also commit to giving you constructive, meaningful feedback whether we decide to move forward together or not.

All interviews will take place remotely, via Zoom.

Your interview will be broken down into three stages, scheduled separately and with feedback after each:

1. A 30 minute interview with our CTO, where we'll tell you about the role, understand your experience and whether there's a good fit to move forward
2. A 90-minute interview, where:
    1. You'll spend 30 minutes talking to our VP Engineering about your experience and background; then
    2. A further 60 minutes talking to our VP Engineering and another engineer on the team where you'll be presented with a high-level technical problem and then you'll discuss a solution to it
3. A second, 90 minute interview, where:
    1. You'll talk to our Head of Operations for 45 minutes about your previous experience, what you want to achieve with your career and how Banked can help you achieve it
    2. You'll then spend the final 45 minutes with our co-founder and CEO so you can learn more about the company, our mission and how this role fits into our success

After this point we should have enough information to make you an offer, should it be appropriate.

You'll be given the chance to ask questions at all of these stages, and we would encourage you to do so. After each of the three stages you'll be given structured feedback and should we choose not to progress you'll be offered the chance to talk with our CTO to understand our decision.
