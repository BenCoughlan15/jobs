### About Banked

Banked intends to create the next global payments network. We believe credit and debit cards were created for a world that no longer exists, and technology will enable us to create a new, living payments network. We believe that the core purpose of a payment network is to enable sales and conversion, not to just move money and we're doing that with data in a way no one has seen before.

We're very fortunate that COVID has meant growth in our business. As more transactions move online and as merchants focus more on improving margins our innovative, fundamentally different model for a payment network is gaining more and more traction.

We've always enabled remote working as a company, and COVID has given us the opportunity to embrace that even more; our team is now 100% distributed, and we believe it's the right way for us to continue to scale our mission.

### About the role and the team

We're looking for someone who shares our vision, who identifies with our desire to reinvent payments and will help guide us through our growth to directly compete with Visa and Mastercard.

You'll participate in the direction of the company and the consistency of the brand throughout our products, you'll be part of small team where everyone has a voice.

As a Senior UI Developer at Banked you'll be working across our client, merchant and partner interfaces to build and test consistent, clean UI components in HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Someone who enjoys working on a small team and wants to share knowledge while continuing to learn and grow will be most successful.

We don't expect people to be experts with all of the technology we use or to immediately be able to pickup all the tasks we might ask of them. We want to build an environment where people can learn and grow openly, where failure is accepted as a part of learning and there's enough support to help people be successful.

Primarily, this role will be working on our customer facing checkout journeys, alongside our reporting and configuration interfaces for merchants.

### You will

- Work closely with our design team and engineers to bring our wireframes and prototypes to life with pixel-perfect accuracy
- Produce and maintain a library of UI components shared across multiple products
- Have significant expertise in CSS, Javascript and HTML
- Care about accessibility, ease of use and UI precision and polish
- Understand browser quirks and compatibility across desktop and mobile
- Mentor and help grow your peers and junior engineers, as well as be open to feedback and mentoring from those around you

### You may be a good fit if you have

- Very strong working experience working with modern JavaScript, Web Components, HTML, CSS
- Experience within a Rails codebase Previously worked with Stimulus Javascript
- Knowledge of automated UI testing and setup
- Worked to integrate A/B testing
- Deep understanding of the web development process, design, development, testing and deployment

### Any combination of the following would make your application stand out

- A portfolio, or links to examples of frontend interfaces you've worked on
- Experience in mentoring and building the skills of junior engineers
- A presence in and experience engaging public web communities Experience building design systems

### The interview process

The interview process will focus on three areas: your experience building products and taking on technical challenges; your technical skills; and how you'll fit in culturally with the rest of the team.

We want to take your time seriously, and use as little of it as possible to make our decision. We will also commit to giving you constructive, meaningful feedback whether we decide to move forward together or not.

1. An initial phone or video call (your preference) with the Engineering Lead to outline the company and the role, and for you to share your career experience. If there's a good fit to move forward, we'll continue with a technical interview.
2. A technical interview with the Engineering Lead alongside another member of the team. It's a chance for you to share your technical knowledge in a little more depth. There are no coding puzzles or quizzes, just a conversation around some case studies and experiences. We'll email out a rough outline of the questions beforehand, so you'll have time to think and prepare. If it's important for you to get a feel for working with the team, or if you prefer to share your skills through coding, we're happy to offer some pairing time.
3. A final stage for you to meet the CTO and Head of Operations to talk through the high level direction of the company, what you want to achieve with your career and how Banked can help you achieve it. At this point we should have enough information to make you an offer, should it be appropriate.
All interviews will take place remotely.

You'll be given the chance to ask questions at all of these stages, and we would encourage you to do so. After each of the three stages you'll be given structured feedback and should we choose not to progress you'll be offered the chance to talk with the team's Engineering Lead to understand our decision.
