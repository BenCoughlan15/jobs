# Senior Android Engineer

### **Job Title**

Senior Software Engineer (Android)

### **Team**

Global Payments

### **Location**

Remote (UK)

### **About Banked**

Banked intends to create the next global payments network. We believe credit and debit cards were created for a world that no longer exists, and technology will enable us to create a new, living payments network. We believe that the core purpose of a payment network is to enable sales and conversion, not to just move money and we're doing that with data in a way no one has seen before.

We're very fortunate that COVID has meant growth in our business. As more transactions move online and as merchants focus more on improving margins our innovative, fundamentally different model for a payment network is gaining more and more traction.

We've always enabled remote working as a company, and COVID has given us the opportunity to embrace that even more; our team is now 100% distributed, and we believe it's the right way for us to continue to scale our mission.

### **About the role and the team**

We're looking for someone who shares our vision, who identifies with our desire to reinvent payments and will help guide us through our growth to directly compete with Visa and Mastercard.

You'll participate in the direction of the company and products, you'll be part of small team where everyone has a voice.

As a Senior Android Engineer at Banked you'll be working on our Android checkout and SDK. Owning the architecture and delivery of a new payment method that will be embedded by our customers in some of the worlds most used Android applications.

Someone who enjoys working on a small team and wants to learn and grow will be most successful.

We don't expect people to be experts with all of the technology we use or to immediately be able to pickup all the tasks we might ask of them. We want to build an environment where people can learn and grow openly, where failure is accepted as a part of learning and there's enough support to help people be successful.

This role is on the Global Payments team, which builds the customer facing products that power our new payment network.

### **You will**

- Work with other engineers, product managers and designers across the company to prioritise, build, measure and iterate over new features or products
- Have very significant experience working on the Android platform with Kotlin
- Have strong experience building and testing for a wide variety of globally deployed devices
- Build elegant interfaces embeddable by our clients and integratable as components; focusing on performance, reliabiliy and developer experience
- Improve engineering standards, tooling and processes as we grow
- Be part of the team evolving architecture and design of our software stack
- Mentor and help grow your peers and junior engineers, as well as be open to feedback and mentoring from those around you

### **You may be a good fit if you have**

- Significant experience in communicating and working with software teams, and working towards building inclusive, fun environments
- Experience building and distributing Android SDKs or other 'embeddable components'
- Building products and tools with a focus on developer experience
- Experience building multi-language and localised Android UIs
- A passion for learning and growth, picking up new skills and tools
- Testing modern native interfaces and code
- Experience building hybrid mobile interfaces (with tools like ReactNative or Flutter)
- A track record of developing for system maintainability and ease of operation
- Deep understanding of the mobile development process, design, development, testing and deployment

### **The interview process**

The interview process will focus on three areas: your experience building products and taking on technical challenges; your technical skills; and how you'll fit in culturally with the rest of the team.

We want to take your time seriously, and use as little of it as possible to make our decision. We will also commit to giving you constructive, meaningful feedback whether we decide to move forward together or not.

1. An intitial phone or video call (your preference) with the Engineering Lead to outline the company and the role, and for you to share your career experience. If there's a good fit to move forward, we'll continue with a technical interview.
2. A technical interview with the Engineering Lead alongside another member of the team. It's a chance for you to share your technical knowledge in a little more depth. There are no coding puzzles or quizzes, just a conversation around some case studies and experiences. We'll email out a rough outline of the questions beforehand, so you'll have time to think and prepare. If it's important for you to get a feel for working with the team, or if you prefer to share your skills through coding, we're happy to offer some pairing time.
3. A final stage for you to meet the CTO and Head of Operations to talk through the high level direction of the company, what you want to achieve with your career and how Banked can help you achieve it. At this point we should have enough information to make you an offer, should it be appropriate.

All interviews will take place remotely.

You'll be given the chance to ask questions at all of these stages, and we would encourage you to do so. After each of the three stages you'll be given structured feedback and should we choose not to progress you'll be offered the chance to talk with the team's Engineering Lead to understand our decision.
