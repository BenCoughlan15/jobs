# Senior Technical Writer : 2-3 month contract

### Job Title

Senior Technical Writer

2 - 3 month contract, with a possible extension to 6 months

### About Banked

Banked intends to create the next global payments network. We believe credit and debit cards were created for a world that no longer exists, and technology will enable us to create a new, living payments network. We believe that the core purpose of a payment network is to enable sales and conversion, not to just move money and we're doing that with data in a way no one has seen before.

We're very fortunate that COVID has meant growth in our business. As more transactions move online and as merchants focus more on improving margins our innovative, fundamentally different model for a payment network is gaining more and more traction.

We've always enabled remote working as a company, and COVID has given us the opportunity to embrace that even more; our team is now 100% distributed, and we believe it's the right way for us to continue to scale our mission.

### **About the role and the team**

We're looking for someone to help us deliver on a Developer Documentation project that will begin in mid October. In this project, we will be creating and hosting technical implementation guides as well as API guides for a joined product offering with one of our partners.

You will be the only dedicated Technical Writer on our Developer Relations team, working closely together with Solution Architects, Engineering and Delivery teams. 

Someone who enjoys working on a small team and wants to learn and grow will be most successful.

We don't expect people to be experts with all of the technology we use or to immediately be able to pickup all the tasks we might ask of them. We want to build an environment where people can learn and grow openly, where failure is accepted as a part of learning and there's enough support to help people be successful.

### **You will**

- Create technical implementation guides based on exiting documentation
- Where existing documentation is lacking, work with relevant stakeholders to understand how the technology works
- Create API documentation
- Ensure the quality of all written content meets our high standards
- Apply our customer's branding guidelines to the documentation
- Help test APIs and integration flows where possible, to ensure all documentation is accurate
- Attend partner meetings alongside Solutions Architects

### **You may be a good fit if you**

- Have an excellent command of English
- Are able to understand and explain complex and highly technical information to both technical and non-technical audience
- Have experience creating top-quality developer documentation, especially around integrating APIs and SDKs
- Are comfortable attending customer meetings
- Have good understanding of REST APIs
- Have experience standardising the tone and style of documentation

### **Any combination of the following would make your application stand out**

- Experience creating top-quality developer documentation from scratch
- Experience documenting Javascript and mobile SDKs
- Experience working on payment products
- Experience using GitHub

### The interview process

The interview process will focus on three areas: your experience in technical writing; your technical understanding; and how you'll fit in culturally with the rest of the team.

We want to take your time seriously, and use as little of it as possible to make our decision. We will also commit to giving you constructive, meaningful feedback whether we decide to move forward together or not.

All interviews will take place remotely, via Zoom.

Your interview will be broken down into three stages, scheduled separately and with feedback after each:

1. We will ask you to send a couple of samples of your previous technical writing work.
2. A 30 minute interview with our Developer Relations Lead, where we'll tell you about the role and the project, understand your experience and whether there's a good fit to move forward
3. A 45-minute interview with our VP Engineering and an Engineer, where we will speak about your experience with technical writing and your background.

After this point we should have enough information to make you an offer, should it be appropriate.

You'll be given the chance to ask questions at all of these stages, and we would encourage you to do so. After each of the three stages you'll be given structured feedback and should we choose not to progress you'll be offered the chance to talk with the Developer Relations Lead to understand our decision.
