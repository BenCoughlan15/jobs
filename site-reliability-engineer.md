### About Banked

Banked intends to create the next global payments network. We believe credit and debit cards were created for a world that no longer exists, and technology will enable us to create a new, living payments network. We believe that the core purpose of a payment network is to enable sales and conversion, not to just move money and we're doing that with data in a way no one has seen before.

We're very fortunate that COVID has meant growth in our business. As more transactions move online and as merchants focus more on improving margins our innovative, fundamentally different model for a payment network is gaining more and more traction.

We've always enabled remote working as a company, and COVID has given us the opportunity to embrace that even more; our team is now 100% distributed, and we believe it's the right way for us to continue to scale our mission.

### The interview process

The interview process will focus on four areas: your experience building and operating systems; your technical skills; and, your ability to work within and support a wider engineering organization; how you'll fit in culturally with the rest of the team.

We want to take your time seriously, and use as little of it as possible to make our decision. We will also commit to giving you constructive, meaningful feedback whether we decide to move forward together or not.

All interviews will take place remotely, via Zoom.

Your interview will be broken down into three stages, scheduled separately and with feedback after each:

1. A 30 minute interview with our CTO, where we'll tell you about the role, understand your experience and whether there's a good fit to move forward
2. A 90-minute interview, where:
    1. You'll spend 30 minutes talking to our VP Engineering about your experience and background; then
    2. A further 60 minutes talking to our VP Engineering and another engineer on the team where you'll be presented with a high-level technical problem and then you'll discuss a solution to it
3. A second, 90 minute interview, where:
    1. You'll talk to our Head of Operations for 45 minutes about your previous experience, what you want to achieve with your career and how Banked can help you achieve it
    2. You'll then spend the final 45 minutes with our co-founder and CEO so you can learn more about the company, our mission and how this role fits into our success

After this point we should have enough information to make you an offer, should it be appropriate.

You'll be given the chance to ask questions at all of these stages, and we would encourage you to do so. After each of the three stages you'll be given structured feedback and should we choose not to progress you'll be offered the chance to talk with our CTO to understand our decision.
