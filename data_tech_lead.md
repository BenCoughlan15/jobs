### About Banked
Banked intends to create the next global payments network. We believe credit and debit cards were created for a world that no longer exists, and technology will enable us to create a new, living payments network. We believe that the core purpose of a payment network is to enable sales and conversion, not to just move money and we're doing that with data in a way no one has seen before.

We're very fortunate that COVID has meant growth in our business. As more transactions move online and as merchants focus more on improving margins our innovative, fundamentally different model for a payment network is gaining more and more traction.

We've always enabled remote working as a company; our team is now 100% distributed, and we believe it's the right way for us to continue to scale our mission.

### **About the role and the team**
We're looking for someone who shares our vision, identifies with our desire to reinvent payments, and will help guide us through our growth and establish our position as a direct competitor to Visa and Mastercard.
You'll participate in setting the direction of the company and products, you'll be part of a team where everyone has a voice.

As a data engineering tech lead at Banked, you'll be leading, hands-on a small team of engineers to build our new datahub. You'll provide the infrastructure and tools to our internal data producers and consumers and also provide the basis for our data-based products.

We don't expect people to be experts with all of the technology we use or to immediately be able to pick up all the tasks we might ask of them. We want to build an environment where people can learn and grow openly, where failure is accepted as a part of learning and there's enough support to help people be successful.

### **You will**
- Lead and mentor a small team of data engineers. 
- Work with partners from analytics and engineering teams to build best-in-class data platform solutions including designing and developing the infrastructure for data pipeline orchestration; designing and implementing tools and microservices for engineering teams to self-serve and create their own data pipelines and data consumption use cases. 
- Define the company’s data engineering roadmap and make sure it’s implemented using the best suitable technologies.
- Collaborate with various stakeholders across the company to advise and make sure our data infrastructure and tooling meet the company's needs.
- Improve engineering standards, tooling, and processes as we grow.

### **You may be a good fit if you have**
- Significant experience in communicating and working with software teams, and working towards building inclusive, fun environments.
- The ability to reason intelligently about complex, uncertain problems and reduce them down to clean, simple abstractions through well-designed systems.
- Experience with production environments/data platforms serving production.
- Experience with ETL pipelines design, implementation, monitoring, and maintenance.
- Highly skilled with SQL, experienced with MPP columnar databases like Snowflake, Redshift, Bigquery, etc.
- Experiance with distributed databases such as cassandra, cloud spanner etc.
- Experience with at least one BI tool such as PowerBI, Tableau, looker etc.
- Experience with Golang or any other programming language.
- A track record of developing for system maintainability and ease of operation.
- Experience developing distributed, reliable, and resilient systems.

 
### **Any combination of the following would make your application stand out**
- Experience in leading teams or mentoring engineers.
- Experience in payments, fintech, or in any mission-critical/regulated industry.
- Experience working with GCP infrastructure and data products.
- Experience with k8s.
- Experience in leading teams.


### The interview process
The interview process will focus on three areas: your experience and taking on technical challenges; your technical skills; and how you'll fit in culturally with the rest of the team.

We want to take your time seriously, and use as little of it as possible to make our decision. We will also commit to giving you constructive, meaningful feedback whether we decide to move forward together or not.

All interviews will take place remotely, via Zoom.

Your interview will be broken down into four stages, scheduled separately and with feedback after each:
1. An initial call with the VP of Engineering to outline the company and the role, and for you to share your career experience. If there's a good fit to move forward, we'll continue with a technical interview.
2. A technical interview with our head of platform. It's a chance for you to share your technical knowledge in a little more depth. We'll outline a few high-level technical problems and discuss possible solutions together.
3. An interview with our VP of Engineering focused more on system architecture and leadership skills.
4. A final stage for you to talk with our Head of People about the high-level direction of the company, what you want to achieve with your career, and how Banked can help you achieve it. At this point we should have enough information to make you an offer, should it be appropriate.

After this point we should have enough information to make you an offer, should it be appropriate.
You'll be given the chance to ask questions at all of these stages, and we would encourage you to do so. After each of the three stages you'll be given structured feedback and should we choose not to progress you'll be offered the chance to talk with our VP of Engineering to understand our decision.
